# Trig calculation examples
# functions like cos work in sagemath, however they require a bit of tinkering to work with radians.
# the function gp(pi) gives us a 32 bit representation of pi, which we will need to convert our result to radians
# to use cos properly for these kinds of equations, we need to take our input and divide it by 360, which itself is divided by pi.

x = cos(30 / (360 / (2 * gp(pi))))

# we can then print out our example, in this case we want to multiply it by the muzzle velocity of 300 m/s

print(x*300)

# result is 259.80762113533159402911695122588085504, matches with our notes
